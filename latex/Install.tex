The package is designed to have fairly minimal requirements to build and use with your projects, but there are some. Currently, we support Linux based paltforms.

\subsubsection*{Linux Requirements}

These are the base requirements to build and use the package (as described below)\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item G\+N\+U-\/compatible Make
\item G\+C\+C compiler (version $>$= 4.\+8.\+3)
\item S\+N\+A\+P (\href{https://snap.stanford.edu/snap/}{\tt https\+://snap.\+stanford.\+edu/snap/} version $>$= 2.\+3)
\item Boost (\href{http://www.boost.org/}{\tt http\+://www.\+boost.\+org/} version $>$= 1.\+58)
\item Gtest (\href{https://github.com/google/googletest}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/google/googletest})
\item Protobuf compiler (\href{https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads}{\tt https\+://developers.\+google.\+com/protocol-\/buffers/docs/downloads} version $>$= 2.\+6.\+0)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{Install_install_sec}{}\section{Installation}\label{Install_install_sec}
The following documentation is correct to the day it was written. case you have problems with my instruction see the packages website for additional information.

\subsubsection*{Build Instructions for root users}

All packages expect S\+N\+A\+P can be installed by running the following command from the directory you downloaded and unpacked the package \begin{DoxyVerb}>./configure
>make
>make install
>make check
\end{DoxyVerb}


To install S\+N\+A\+P just run the following command from the unpacked directory\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}>make all
\end{DoxyVerb}


Since S\+N\+A\+P build is local you need to indicate its location for this package build. You do it using the config.\+site file. See non root users and only place the details that are relevant to S\+N\+A\+P.

\subsubsection*{Build Instructions for non root users}

The standard way to install packages when you don\textquotesingle{}t have root privileges it to use the --prefix option when running the ./configure \begin{DoxyVerb}>./configure --prefix=<path>
\end{DoxyVerb}


The above command will cause the package to be installed in the path given in the --prefix option. S\+N\+A\+P doesn\textquotesingle{}t require any additional option and just type \begin{DoxyVerb}>make all 
\end{DoxyVerb}


From the directory you unpacked the source. Since you installed the packages in you desired location you need to list them in a file that will allow the package to find them and link with them and this is where config.\+site comes into play. After you installed Gtest (in \$\{G\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\}), S\+N\+A\+P (in \$\{S\+N\+A\+P\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\}) and P\+R\+O\+T\+O\+B\+U\+F (in \$\{P\+R\+O\+T\+O\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\}) create a file named config.\+site (I ommit Boost but if you need to install it just do the same as the others).

The file should contain the location of S\+N\+A\+P and Gtest\+:

\paragraph*{config.\+site content}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS} -I${GTEST_DIR}/include/ -I{SNAP_DIR}/snap-adv/ \
-I{SNAP_DIR}/snap-core/ -I{SNAP_DIR}/snap-exp/ -I{SNAP_DIR}/glib-core/ -I${PROTO_DEST}/include/" 
LIBS="${LIBS} {SNAP_DIR}/snap-core/Snap.o ${GTEST_DIR}/libgtest.a -lpthread"
LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -L${PROTO_DEST}/lib"
PROTOC="${PROTO_DEST}/bin/protoc"
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${PROTO_DEST}/lib/pkgconfig/" 
\end{DoxyVerb}


\paragraph*{Example for a config.\+site}

\begin{DoxyVerb}CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS} -I/work/eng/eliavb/googletest-release-1.7.0/include/ -I/work/eng/eliavb/Snap-2.3/snap-adv/ -I/work/eng/eliavb/Snap-2.3/snap-core/ -I/work/eng/eliavb/Snap-2.3/snap-exp/ -I/work/eng/eliavb/Snap-2.3/glib-core/ -I/work/eng/eliavb/protobuf_install/include/" 
LIBS="${LIBS} /work/eng/eliavb/Snap-2.3/snap-core/Snap.o /work/eng/eliavb/googletest-release-1.7.0/libgtest.a -lpthread"
LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -L/work/eng/eliavb/protobuf_install/lib/"
PROTOC="/work/eng/eliavb/protobuf_install/bin/protoc"
\end{DoxyVerb}


Case you enounter\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}configure: error: Package requirements (protobuf >= 2.6.0) were not met:

No package 'protobuf' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.
\end{DoxyVerb}


Try changing the package config env variable using the following command\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}export PKG_CONFIG_PATH='${PROTO_DEST}/lib/pkgconfig/'   
\end{DoxyVerb}


Case you encounter\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}error while loading shared libraries: libprotobuf.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
\end{DoxyVerb}


Try\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRAY_PATH:${PROTO_DEST}/lib/" 
\end{DoxyVerb}


\paragraph*{C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+\_\+\+S\+I\+T\+E}

After the file was created we need to set an env variable named C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+\_\+\+S\+I\+T\+E to point to the config.\+site\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}>export CONFIG_SITE=$CONFIG_SITE:<path>/config.site
\end{DoxyVerb}


\paragraph*{B\+U\+I\+L\+D! non root users}

Suppose you placed the package in \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\} and want to install it in \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\}.

Enter to the \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\} and run\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}>./configure --prefix=${ADS_DEST}
>make
>make install
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Checking the install was a success non root users}

Since this is not a root install we need to add the location of the proto lib \begin{DoxyVerb}>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${PROTO_DEST}/lib
>make check
\end{DoxyVerb}


\paragraph*{B\+U\+I\+L\+D! root users}

Suppose you placed the package in \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\}.

Enter to the \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+I\+R\} and run\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}>./configure
>make
>make install
>make check\end{DoxyVerb}
