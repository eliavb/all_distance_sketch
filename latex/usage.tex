\subsection*{Integrating with your code}

To use the package in your code you must include \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\}/include/all\+\_\+distance\+\_\+sketch.h and link with \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\}/lib/liball\+\_\+distance\+\_\+sketch.a

Compiling your\+\_\+code.\+cpp\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}>g++ --std=c++11  your_code.cpp -I${SNAP_DEST}/snap-adv/ -I${SNAP_DEST}/snap-core/ -I${SNAP_DEST}/snap-exp/ -I${SNAP_DEST}/glib-core/  ${ADS_DEST}/lib/liball_distance_sketch.a ${SNAP_DEST}/snap-core/Snap.o  -o your_code
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Using as command line app}

You can run the algorithms as apps. When building the pakcage the apps will be located in the \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\}/bin. run --help to see the options that each such app can take. The application that calculates the all distance sketch\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}>./bin/sketch_app --help
Usage: options_description [options]
Allowed options:

  --directed arg         is the graph directed
  --graph_dir arg        Directory with the graph to calculate the sketch on
  --output_file arg      output file path pattern, here the sketch Gpb will be saved with the 
                         prefix entered and suffix _[%d]

  --directed arg         is the graph directed
  --graph_dir arg        Directory with the graph to calculate the sketch on
  --sketch_file arg      File prefix with the calculated sketch. The prefix should match what you entered in the sketch_app 
  --output_file arg      output file path, here the sketch Gpb will be saved 
                         (Gpb defined in src/proto/all_distance_sketch.proto)
\end{DoxyVerb}


App for calculating the exact reverse rank greedy cover.

\begin{DoxyVerb}>bin/t_skim_exact_app --help
    Allowed options:
  --help                produce help message
  --T arg               Defines the influence of a node. If pi_{us} < T then s 
                        coveres u
  --directed arg        is the graph directed
  --graph_dir arg       Directory with the graph to calculate the sketch on
  --output_file arg     output file path, here the cover will be saved in Gpb
