\subsection*{Integrating with your code}

To use the package in your code you must include \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\}/include/all\+\_\+distance\+\_\+sketch.h and link with \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\}/lib/liball\+\_\+distance\+\_\+sketch.a

Compiling your\+\_\+code.\+cpp\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}>g++ --std=c++11  your_code.cpp -I${SNAP_DEST}/snap-adv/ -I${SNAP_DEST}/snap-core/ -I${SNAP_DEST}/snap-exp/ -I${SNAP_DEST}/glib-core/  ${ADS_DEST}/lib/liball_distance_sketch.a ${SNAP_DEST}/snap-core/Snap.o  -o your_code
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Using as command line app}

You can run the algorithms as apps. When building the pakcage the apps will be located in the \$\{A\+D\+S\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\}/bin. run --help to see the options that each such app can take. The application that calculates the all distance sketch\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}>./bin/sketch_app --helpUsage: options_description [options]
Allowed options:
  --help                 produce help message
  --K arg                K = 1/epsilon^2 sets the precision
  --num_threads arg (=1) num_threads to use
  --directed arg         is the graph directed
  --graph_dir arg        Directory with the graph to calculate the sketch on
  --output_file arg      output file path, here the sketch Gpb will be saved 
                         (Gpb defined in src/proto/all_distance_sketch.proto)\end{DoxyVerb}
